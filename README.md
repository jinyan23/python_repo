### `bus_arrival`
This is a web application that provides bus arrival information, bus routes and list of bus stops. It works similarly to mobile applications for bus arrival found on iOS or Android. It is built using the interactive Python Dash interface with callback functionality built in. The data is obtained from LTA Datamall API calls.

This web application can only be run on local host server, as pushing up to be hosted on Dash server requires paid subscription. [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a similar interactive dashboard that is free (up to five applications running), if anyone is interested. 

### `python_snippets`
This is just a random collections of python codes for indexing and creating new dimensions when generating data.
